OSDCNET

The Open Source Distributed Computing Network (OSDCNET) aims to create a wide

written entirely in Python and is both hosted and operated using
[GitHub](https://github.com/osdcnet/osdcnet).

While OSDCNET is built in Python, users are encouraged to build libraries for
other programming languages.
